**Query:** Que significa "laburo" en el español argentino?



**Response:**

◁think▷Okay, the user is asking what "laburo" means in Argentine Spanish. Let me start by recalling my knowledge. I know that in some countries, "laburo" is a loanword from English, specifically "job." But in Argentina, it's used differently. I think it's often used to refer to a temporary or short-term job, maybe even a part-time one. But wait, isn't there another term, "laburar," which means to work? So "laburo" would be the noun form.

I should check if there's a distinction between "laburo" and "trabajo." Maybe "laburo" is more informal or refers to a job that's not stable. Also, in Argentina, the economy has had some instability, so people might use "laburo" to describe jobs that are temporary or not well-paid. For example, a student might have a "laburo" as a part-time job. But I need to confirm if that's accurate.

Another angle: in some contexts, "laburo" could be used to mean a job that's not fulfilling or a job that someone does out of necessity, not passion. But I'm not sure if that's the primary meaning. Also, in other Spanish-speaking countries, "laburo" might not be used as much, so the Argentine usage is specific.

I should also consider examples. If someone says, "Tengo un laburo en un café," they might mean a part-time job at a café. But if they say, "El laburo es difícil," they might be referring to the difficulty of finding a job. Wait, but "laburo" as a noun could be the job itself, while "laburar" is the verb. So "laburo" is the job, and "laburar" is to work.

I need to make sure there's no confusion with other terms. For instance, "trabajo" is the general term for job, while "laburo" is more colloquial and might imply something temporary or informal. Also, in some regions, "laburo" might be used to refer to a job that's not well-paid or has low status. But I should verify if that's a common usage.

Another thought: in Argentina, the economy has had issues with inflation and unemployment, so people might use "laburo" to describe jobs that are precarious or not secure. For example, gig economy jobs or short-term contracts. So "laburo" could carry a connotation of instability or informality.

I should also check if there's any regional variation within Argentina. Maybe in some areas, "laburo" is more commonly used than others. But generally, it's understood across the country. Additionally, in some contexts, "laburo" might be used to refer to a job that's not a career but just a way to make money, like a temporary job.

To sum up, "laburo" in Argentine Spanish refers to a job, often temporary, informal, or part-time. It's a loanword from English "job," but used differently than in other Spanish-speaking countries. It can imply a job that's not stable or well-paid, and it's commonly used in everyday conversation to describe such jobs.◁/think▷En el español argentino, **"laburo"** es una palabra que se usa principalmente para referirse a un **trabajo temporal, informal o de bajo estatus**. Es una adaptación del inglés *"job"* (trabajo), pero con un significado más coloquial y específico en el contexto argentino. Aquí sus usos más comunes:

1. **Trabajo temporal o precario**:  
   Se aplica a puestos que no son estables, como **trabajos temporales** (ej.: "Tengo un laburo en un café"), **part-time** (ej.: "El laburo es de 6 horas"), o **gig economy** (ej.: "Trabajo como driver de Uber").  
   *Nota*: En algunos contextos, también puede usarse para describir empleos con salarios bajos o poco valorados.

2. **Trabajo no profesional o no clásico**:  
   Se le atribuye a roles que no son considerados "trabajos formales", como **trabajar en una tienda** o **en un kiosco**, incluso si son temporales.

3. **Connotación negativa o despectiva**:  
   En algunos casos, se usa para criticar un empleo poco gratificante o con poco reconocimiento social (ej.: "El laburo no es lo que esperaba").
