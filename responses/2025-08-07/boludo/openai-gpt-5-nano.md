**Reasoning:**

**Explaining word usage**

It's best to focus on the accepted usage of the word rather than uncertain etymology. The term "boludo" (for males) and "boluda" (for females) is widely used in both insulting and friendly contexts, particularly in Buenos Aires. It carries strong connotations in central Argentina but can translate to "idiot" or "fool" elsewhere. For example, "Qué boludo sos" is extremely insulting, while "Che, boludo, vamos a la cancha" is friendly. Regional variations matter too!**Discussing language nuances**

I should mention phrases like "no seas boludo" and "no seas boludo/a," along with the term "boludear," which means to act stupid. "Boludo" can appear in phrases like "¡Sos boludo!" translating to "You're dumb." It's important to note that in formal Spanish, "boludo" is considered vulgar, so it's better to avoid it with strangers. 

Key points include its dual use in Argentina as either an insult or a friendly term, the social context when using it, and alternative words like "pelotudo" or "tarado," which are stronger in meaning.**Clarifying language strength**

Yes, "pelotudo" is a synonym for "boludo," but it's considered stronger. 

Regarding social acceptance, some people find "boludo" acceptable, while "boluda" for women can also be used but isn't recommended with strangers. It's best to be cautious with both terms, especially in unfamiliar social situations, as they can carry different connotations depending on the context and the people involved.**Explaining the term "boludo"**

It's better to present accepted usage rather than uncertain etymology. "Boludo" is widely used as both an insult and a term of camaraderie, with the masculine form "boludo" and the feminine "boluda." The term can mean "fool" or "idiot," especially in Buenos Aires, but among friends, it's common and less severe. For example, "Qué boludo sos" is quite insulting, while "Che, boludo, vamos a la cancha" is more casual. The feminine form can also be friendly, not just insulting.**Clarifying the term "boludo"**

Let's delve into phrases like "no seas boludo" and "no seas boludo/a" while also noting "boludear," which means to act stupid. "Boludo" shows up in expressions like "¡Sos boludo!" meaning "You're dumb." In formal Spanish, it's considered vulgar, so it's best to avoid it in formal settings or around strangers. 

The term has two main uses in Argentina: as an insult or a friendly term among close friends. Alternatives like "pelotudo" carry a stronger meaning that refers to someone as "stupid," derived from the word for "ball."**Discussing "pelotudo" and acceptance**

Yes, "pelotudo" is a synonym for "boludo," but it's a stronger term. In terms of social acceptance, some people find "boludo" acceptable to use among friends, while "boluda" for women is generally less recommended unless you have a close relationship. It’s always better to avoid these terms with those you don’t know, as context matters significantly in how language is perceived.
