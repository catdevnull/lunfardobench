# qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507 - What does "che" mean?

**Query:** Que significa "che" en el español argentino?

**Reasoning:**


Okay, the user is asking what "che" means in Argentine Spanish. Let me start by recalling what I know about this term.

First, I remember that "che" is a very common interjection in Argentina, especially associated with Argentine Spanish. It's famously used by Che Guevara, whose nickname came from this very word. But I need to explain its usage properly.

So, "che" is used as a vocative, like calling someone's attention. Similar to "hey" in English or "oye" in other Spanish dialects. For example, "Che, ¿cómo estás?" would be "Hey, how are you?"

I should mention that it's informal and widely used in everyday conversation. It's not exclusive to Argentina, but it's particularly characteristic there. Maybe also in Uruguay and other neighboring countries, but the user specified Argentine Spanish, so focus on that.

Also, it's important to note that "che" doesn't have a direct translation; it's more of a filler word or a way to address someone. Sometimes it's used to express surprise or to get someone's attention, like "Che, mirá esto" (Hey, look at this).

Wait, I should check if there are other nuances. Maybe in some contexts it can be used to express confusion or to fill a pause, but I think the primary use is as a vocative.

Also, need to clarify that it's not considered rude, but it's very colloquial. So in formal situations, it's better to avoid it.

Let me structure the answer: start by stating it's a common interjection, explain its use as a vocative, give examples, mention its origin (maybe from Guarani or slang), and note its cultural significance with Che Guevara.

Wait, the origin: I think "che" comes from the Guarani language, which is spoken in Paraguay and parts of Argentina. In Guarani, "che" means "I" or "me," but in Argentine Spanish, it evolved into a vocative. Or maybe it's from slang. I should verify that.

Upon checking, yes, it's believed to have origins in the Guarani language, where "che" is a possessive pronoun meaning "my." But in Rioplatense Spanish (Argentina and Uruguay), it became a way to address someone, similar to "mate" in other regions.

So, the answer should include that it's a vocative particle, used to call someone, examples, origin, and cultural note about Che Guevara.

Also, maybe mention that it's so characteristic that people from other Spanish-speaking countries might associate it with Argentines.

Avoid any mistakes: don't say it's a verb or has a literal translation. It's an interjection.

Check if there are other uses. For example, in some contexts, "che" can be used to express doubt, like "Che, ¿estás seguro?" but that's still as a vocative.

Yes, so the main points are:

- Common interjection in Argentine Spanish.

- Used to get attention, address someone informally.

- Equivalent to "hey," "dude," "man."

- Origin from Guarani.

- Cultural reference to Che Guevara.

- Not rude, but informal.

Examples: "Che, ¿vamos a comer?" / "Che, ¿qué onda?"

Make sure to explain that it's not used in all Spanish-speaking countries the same way; it's specific to the Río de la Plata region.

Also, maybe note that in some other countries, "che" might not be used or could have different meanings, but the question is about Argentine Spanish.

Double-check if there's any other nuance. For instance, in Spain, "che" isn't commonly used; they might use "tío" or "oye."

Okay, I think that's comprehensive. Now, structure the answer clearly, step by step, in Spanish since the user asked in Spanish. Wait, the user's question is in Spanish: "Que significa "che" en el español argentino?" So the answer should be in Spanish as well.

Wait, the user wrote the question in Spanish, but the instruction says the assistant is Qwen, a large language model. The user might expect the answer in Spanish. Let me check the initial instruction.

The user's message is in Spanish, so the appropriate response is in Spanish. The previous example shows the assistant responding in the same language as the user. So I should answer in Spanish.

So, translating my points into Spanish.

Start with: "Che" es una interjección muy común en el español argentino...

Explain usage, examples, origin, Che Guevara, etc.

Make sure to use correct terms in Spanish.

Also, check for any possible errors. For example, in Guarani, "
