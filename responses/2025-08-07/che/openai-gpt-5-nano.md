I’m a bit confused about the word "che." It existed as a nickname for Che Guevara, but "che" predates him and was popularized globally by him. As for its origin, it’s often debated: some say it comes from Mapudungun, meaning "people," while others suggest it might come from Italian or be borrowed from Guarani.
