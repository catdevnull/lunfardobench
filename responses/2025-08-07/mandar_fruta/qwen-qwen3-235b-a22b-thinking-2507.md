**Query:** Que significa "mandar fruta" en el español argentino?

**Reasoning:**


Okay, the user is asking what "mandar fruta" means in Argentine Spanish. Let me start by recalling if I've heard this phrase before. I know that in some Spanish-speaking countries, "fruta" can have slang meanings, but I'm not sure about Argentina specifically.

First, I should check if "mandar fruta" is a common expression there. Maybe it's similar to other Latin American countries. Wait, in Mexico, "mandar flores" is to flirt, but "fruta" is fruit. Hmm. Maybe in Argentina, "fruta" has a different connotation.

I remember that in some contexts, "fruta" can be slang for something else. Wait, in Argentina, "fruta" might be used as a derogatory term for a gay person, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. But the phrase is "mandar fruta," which literally means "to send fruit." That doesn't make much sense literally, so it's probably an idiom.

Let me think of other Argentine slang. They use a lot of Lunfardo terms. Maybe "mandar fruta" is part of that. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistranslation or a phrase that's not commonly used. Wait, maybe it's "mandar una fruta," but the user wrote "mandar fruta" without the article.

Wait, another angle: in some contexts, "mandar" can mean "to say" or "to utter," like "mandar un mensaje." So "mandar fruta" could mean "to say something fruity," but what's "fruta" here? If "fruta" is slang for nonsense or something silly, then "mandar fruta" would mean to say something stupid or nonsensical.

Wait, in Spain, "fruta" isn't commonly used that way, but in Argentina, maybe. Let me check some sources. Oh, right! In Argentine slang, "fruta" can mean "nonsense" or "bullshit." So "mandar fruta" would translate to "to talk nonsense" or "to say something stupid."

Wait, but I should confirm. Let me think of similar expressions. In Mexico, "mandar alv" is to tell someone off, but that's different. In Argentina, "mandar fruta" might be similar to "decir pavadas," which means to say silly things. So "fruta" here is like "pavada," meaning nonsense.

Another possibility: maybe "fruta" is short for "frutilla," but that's strawberry. Not sure. Wait, in some contexts, "fruta" can be used as a slang term for a foolish person, but "mandar fruta" as a phrase... Maybe it's an old expression.

Wait, I found a reference that in Argentina, "mandar fruta" is an old Lunfardo expression meaning to lie or to say something false. But I need to verify. Alternatively, maybe it's not commonly used anymore. Let me check a few more sources.

Alternatively, maybe it's a confusion with "mandar una fruta," but the user specified "mandar fruta." Hmm. Wait, another thought: in some contexts, "fruta" can mean "easy target" or "something easy to get," but that's more in Caribbean Spanish. Not sure about Argentina.

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to "mandar fruta" as in sending fruit, but in a slang context. Maybe in a specific situation, like in a game or a metaphor. But the user is asking about Argentine Spanish, so it's likely a colloquialism.

Wait, I think I remember now. In Argentina, "fruta" can be slang for "nonsense" or "bullshit," so "mandar fruta" would mean to talk nonsense. For example, if someone is exaggerating or lying, you might say "¡Dejá de mandar fruta!" meaning "Stop talking nonsense!"

Let me check an example. If someone says, "Ayer gané la lotería," and it's obviously a lie, another person might respond, "¡Qué fruta mandás!" So "mandar fruta" is to say something untrue or silly.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer would be that in Argentine Spanish, "mandar fruta" means to say something false, exaggerated, or nonsensical; to talk nonsense. It's similar to "decir pavadas" or "hablar boludeces."

I should also mention that it's informal and part of colloquial speech, maybe Lunfardo influence. Also, note that "fruta" in this context doesn't refer to actual fruit but is used metaphorically.
