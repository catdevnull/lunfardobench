**Explaining "fiaca" in Rioplatense slang**

"Fiaca" refers to laziness or reluctance to do something, similar to "pereza" or "flojera." It functions as both a noun and in phrases. For example, "hacer fiaca" means to act lazily or to postpone tasks, while "dar fiaca" refers to feeling lazy or finding something hard to do. People might say, "Me da fiaca estudiar" (I don't feel like studying) or "Hoy voy a hacer fiaca," indicating they'll slack off. It's used more informally, though.**Exploring the phrase "andar con fiaca"**

I'm looking into the phrase "andar con fiaca," which suggests moving slowly. It seems "fiaca" might come from the Italian "fiacca," meaning laziness. The DRAE notes "fiaca" reflects a sense of laziness in Argentina, synonymous with terms like "pereza" and "flojera." When someone says "es un fiaca," they refer to a lazy person. Also, "hacer fiaca" means to skip work or pretend to be sick, like when someone decides, "Hoy no quiero ir al trabajo, voy a hacer fiaca.”**Clarifying "hacer fiaca" in Argentine slang**

I'm confirming that in Argentine slang, "hacer fiaca" means to avoid doing something or to drag one's feet, reflecting a sense of laziness. It can express reluctance, like saying "No importa, hacer fiaca." For example, someone might say, "Tengo que estudiar, pero voy a hacer fiaca un rato," meaning they'll procrastinate. Another example is, "Hoy hay que ir a trabajar y mi fiaca me ganó," which illustrates being overtaken by laziness. Also, "me da fiaca" translates to "I'm too lazy" or "I don't feel like it," which is quite common.**Explaining "fiaca" in Rioplatense slang**

Fiaca is Rioplatense slang that encapsulates feelings of laziness and reluctance, similar to "pereza" or "flojera." It can work as both a noun (la fiaca) and in phrases like "tener fiaca," "dar fiaca," or "hacer fiaca." "Hacer fiaca" indicates acting lazily or procrastinating, while "dar fiaca" means feeling too lazy to do something. For instance, "Me da fiaca estudiar" translates to "I don't feel like studying," and "Hoy voy a hacer fiaca" means "I will slack off today." However, "hacer fiaca" is less common in serious discussions.
