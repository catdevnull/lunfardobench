# qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507 - What does "chamuyar" mean?

**Query:** Que significa "chamuyar" en el espa√±ol argentino?

**Reasoning:**


Okay, the user is asking what "chamuyar" means in Argentine Spanish. Let me start by recalling my knowledge of Spanish slang, especially from Argentina.

First, I know that Argentine Spanish has a lot of unique slang terms, often influenced by Lunfardo, which is the slang from Buenos Aires. Words like "laburar" for trabajar (to work) or "fiaca" for laziness come to mind.

Now, "chamuyar". I think I've heard this before. Let me break it down. The root might be "chamuyo". I remember that "chamuyo" is a noun meaning smooth talk, flattery, or sweet talk. So "chamuyar" would be the verb form, meaning to sweet-talk or to charm someone with words.

Wait, but I should confirm. Maybe it's related to "chamuyero", which is someone who talks a lot or is a smooth talker. Yeah, that makes sense. So "chamuyar" is the action of using smooth talk to persuade or deceive someone, often in a playful or flirtatious way.

Let me check if there are other possible meanings. Sometimes slang can have multiple connotations. In some contexts, it might imply lying or exaggerating, but the primary meaning is more about charming or flattering.

Also, considering the user specified Argentine Spanish, I should make sure it's not used differently in other countries. For example, in some places, similar words might have different meanings, but in Argentina, "chamuyar" is definitely about smooth talking.

Examples would help. Like, "√âl siempre chamuya a las chicas para salir con ellas" meaning "He always sweet-talks girls to go out with them."

I should also mention that it's informal and commonly used in colloquial speech. Maybe note that it's part of Lunfardo, which adds cultural context.

Wait, is "chamuyo" of African origin? I think Lunfardo has influences from various languages, including Italian and African dialects. But maybe that's more detail than needed. The user just wants the meaning, but adding a bit about origin could be helpful.

Double-checking with reliable sources. From what I recall, "chamuyo" comes from the Quechua word "chamurri", but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, some sources say it's from the Spanish "chamullo", which means a lie or tall tale. Hmm, conflicting info. Maybe better to stick to the commonly accepted definition without delving into uncertain etymology.

So, the main points: "chamuyar" means to sweet-talk, charm, or flatter, often with the intention to persuade or deceive playfully. Common in Argentina, informal, from Lunfardo.

Make sure to present it clearly, maybe with an example sentence. Also, note that it's a colloquial term, so not used in formal contexts.
