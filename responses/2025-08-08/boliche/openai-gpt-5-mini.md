**Reasoning:**

**Explaining 'boliche' meanings**

The user is asking about the meaning of "boliche" in Argentine Spanish. It primarily refers to a nightclub or disco, where people dance. However, it can also mean a small shop or store, especially in rural areas, like a grocery store. In some contexts, "boliche" might also refer to a bowling alley, but that’s less common in Argentina. The term has roots from Italian, suggesting a connection to the word for small ball.**Explaining 'boliche' origins and context**

The term "boliche" could derive from "bola" (ball), suggesting a connection to toy balls. I want to provide synonyms like "discoteca," "pub," and "almacén." 

It's important to note regional differences: in Buenos Aires, it often means nightclub, while in rural areas, it can refer to a grocery store or local bar. In Uruguay, it also means nightclub, but in Spain, it's not commonly used at all. 

I'll include informal examples and note any potential negative connotations, like suggesting a bordello.**Defining 'boliche' meanings**

I need to clarify that "boliche" primarily means nightclub (discoteca) or a small neighborhood store (almacén), and it can also refer to a bar. It has informal and regional usages, so I should provide example sentences with translations in English. 

I will craft the answer in Spanish while keeping it concise and clear, ensuring that the user understands these nuances and informal aspects. That way, they can see the variations in context!

**Response:**

En el español de Argentina "boliche" se usa sobre todo de forma coloquial y tiene dos sentidos principales, según el contexto y la zona:

- Discoteca/antro/club nocturno: lugar para salir a bailar o tomar algo por la noche. Ej.: "¿Vamos al boliche el sábado?" = "Shall we go to the club on Saturday?"
- Almacén/tiendita de barrio o bar pequeño: en muchas localidades (sobre todo del interior) "el boliche" es la tienda de la esquina o un bar de pueblo. Ej.: "Paso por el boliche y te traigo pan." = "I'll stop by the corner shop and bring you bread."

Es un término informal; su uso y predominio (discoteca vs. almacén) varía según la región dentro del país.
