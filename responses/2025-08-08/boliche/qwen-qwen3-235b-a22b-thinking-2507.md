**Query:** Que significa "boliche" en el espa√±ol argentino?

**Reasoning:**


Okay, the user is asking what "boliche" means in Argentine Spanish. Let me start by recalling that "boliche" in standard Spanish usually refers to a bowling alley. But since they specified Argentine Spanish, I know that in some Latin American countries, words can have different slang meanings.

I remember that in Argentina, "boliche" is commonly used to mean a bar or a nightclub. Wait, but I should double-check to make sure. Maybe it's also used for other things. Let me think. In some contexts, "boliche" can refer to a small shop or a grocery store, but I think that's more common in other countries like Mexico. In Argentina, I believe it's more about the place where people go out.

Wait, another angle: in Argentina, "boliche" might also refer to a type of establishment that serves drinks and maybe food, similar to a pub or a dive bar. Sometimes it's used colloquially for a place that's not too fancy. Let me confirm. Yes, in Argentina, "boliche" is slang for a bar or a nightclub, especially a more casual or traditional one. It's important to note that it's not the standard term, which would be "bar" or "discoteca," but in local slang, "boliche" is widely used.

Also, I should check if there are other meanings. For example, in some regions, "boliche" can mean a ball, but that's probably not the case here. The user is asking about Argentine Spanish specifically, so the main meaning is the bar/nightclub. Maybe mention that it's informal and used in everyday language. Also, maybe give an example sentence to clarify usage.

Wait, I should make sure not to confuse with other countries. For instance, in Mexico, "boliche" might mean a small store, but in Argentina, it's definitely the bar. Let me verify with a reliable source. According to Argentine slang dictionaries, "boliche" is a common term for a bar or a place to drink and socialize. Sometimes it can have a slightly negative connotation, implying a less reputable place, but not always. It's mostly neutral.

So the answer should state that in Argentine Spanish, "boliche" refers to a bar or nightclub, explain it's colloquial, and maybe note that it's different from the standard Spanish meaning of bowling alley. Also, perhaps mention that it's part of the local slang and widely understood in Argentina.


**Response:**

En el **espa√±ol argentino**, la palabra **"boliche"** tiene un significado coloquial muy extendido que **no se refiere al juego de bolos** (como en el espa√±ol est√°ndar), sino a un **bar, boliches nocturnos o locales bailables** donde se consume bebida, se escucha m√∫sica y se socializa. Es un t√©rmino informal y muy com√∫n en el √°mbito cotidiano de Argentina.

### Detalles clave:
- **Contexto**: Se usa para describir **bares, pubs o discotecas**, especialmente aquellos de ambiente relajado, tradicional o incluso algo "cancheros" (informales, sin mucha pretensi√≥n).
  - Ejemplo: *"Vamos al boliche esta noche, ¬øte sum√°s?"* (¬øVamos al bar/noche a bailar?).
- **Connotaci√≥n**: Puede tener un matiz neutro o ligeramente despectivo, dependiendo del contexto (ej.: *"Ese boliche es medio peligroso"* ‚Üí un lugar poco recomendable).
- **Diferencia con otros pa√≠ses**: En pa√≠ses como M√©xico o Colombia, "boliche" suele significar **tienda de abarrotes** o negocio peque√±o, pero **en Argentina no se usa as√≠**.

### Curiosidad:
El t√©rmino probablemente surgi√≥ por la analog√≠a con los **"boliches" antiguos** (locales donde se jugaba a los bolos), que evolucionaron a espacios de esparcimiento con bebidas. Con el tiempo, el nombre se extendi√≥ a cualquier bar o lugar de fiesta.

¬°As√≠ que si est√°s en Argentina y alguien te invita a "ir al boliche", prep√°rate para tomar algo y bailar! üé≥üçª
